abstract = "Abstract Automatic reprogramming is an important and challenging issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). A usual approach is the over-the-air programming (OAP), which is a fundamental service based on reliable broadcast for efficient code dissemination. However, existing \{OAP\} protocols do not enable the reprogramming of a subset of the sensor nodes in a WSN. Hence, in this work we propose a multicast-based over-the-air programming protocol that considers a small world infrastructure (MOAP-SW). The small world model is used to create shortcuts toward the sink in the communication infrastructure of sensor networks. The endpoints of these shortcuts are more powerful nodes, resulting in a heterogeneous wireless sensor network. Simulation results show the feasibility of the protocol regarding the number of messages transmitted, the energy consumption and the time to reconfigure the network. "

   can be received by a sensor node and devise a scheme to detect anomalous
   changes in this arrival process. Our detection algorithm keeps
   short-term dynamic statistics using a multi-level, sliding window event

Abstract = {{This research aims to propose a novel decentralised coverage protocol
   known as square-grid blanket coverage control algorithm for
   self-deployments of autonomous robotic wireless sensor networks in the
   open corridors as a means to discourage any intrusions. The algorithm
   advocates a distributed solution and is asymptotically optimal in the
   sense of uniformity. The motion coordination scheme employed is due to
   the nearest neighbour technique which is implemented for the purpose of
   clustering and coordination among mobile sensor nodes in local area
   (vicinity), that is, to achieve uniform and distributed solutions for
   both 1-barrier coverage as an initial thrust of this research as well as
   our square-grid blanket coverage. Having successfully achieved 1-barrier
   coverage, mobile sensor nodes are subsequently moved in the systematic
   zigzag (snake-like) pattern by utilising local information obtained from
   their neighbourhoods to achieve the desired square-grid lattice.
   Research points out that simple motion coordination schemes have
   resulted in a powerful, efficient and intelligent control algorithm to
   achieve the desired coverage. To manifest the efficacy of the proposed
   algorithm, several computer simulations have been conducted accordingly.}},

	Abstract = {{Cryptographic algorithms play an important role in the security architecture of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Choosing the most storage- and energy-efficient block cipher is essential, due to the facts that these networks are meant to operate without human intervention for a long period of time with little energy supply, and that available storage is scarce on these sensor nodes. However, to our knowledge, no systematic work has been done in this area so far. We construct an evaluation framework in which we first identify the candidates of block ciphers suitable for WSNs, based on existing literature and authoritative recommendations. For evaluating and assessing these candidates, we not only consider the security properties but also the storage- and energy-efficiency of the candidates. Finally, based on the evaluation results, we select the most suitable ciphers for WSNs, namely Skipjack, MISTY1, and Rijndael, depending on the combination of available memory and required security (energy efficiency being implicit). In terms of operation mode, we recommend Output Feedback Mode for pairwise links but Cipher Block Chaining for group communications.}},

	Abstract = {Due to the sensitive and often personal nature of sensor data that many wireless sensor networks collect, the security of this data must be guaranteed. This is fast becoming an important concern for sensor networks which are finding applications in the military and home health domains. The best and often the only way to secure this data is to encrypt it using a secure encryption algorithm before it is transmitted over the air ways. Due to the constrained nature of the resources, memory and clock speeds, available on sensor nodes however, the cost, both in terms of power consumption and speed of encryption, of a software based encryption procedure can often outweigh the risks of the transmission being intercepted. This paper presents a solution to reduce this cost of employing encryption by taking advantage of a resource already available on many sensor nodes, including the Crossbow MICAz and MoteIV’s TmoteSKY; this resource being the AES encryption module available on the Chipcon CC2420 transceiver chip. The performance of using this method of securing data on a sensor network against using software implementations of some of the most popular cipher algorithms suitable for WSN is then analysed for both hardware platforms}

Limitations in processing speed, battery power, bandwidth and memory constrain the applicability of existing cryptography Algorithms for WSNs. Several security mechanisms, such as TinySec, have been introduced to address the need for security in WSNs. The cost of security, however, still mostly remains an unknown variable. To provide a better understanding of this cost we have studied three encryption algorithms, AES, RC5 and RC6. We have measured and compared their memory and energy consumption on Mica2 sensor motes. The results of our experiments provide insight into the suitability of different security algorithms for use in WSN environments and could be used by WSN designers to construct the security architecture of their systems in a way that both satisfies the requirements of the application and reasonably uses the constrained sensor resources.},

	Abstract = {{Since Rijndael was chosen as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), improving upon 7-round attacks on the 128-bit key variant (out of 10 rounds) or upon 8-round attacks on the 192/256-bit key variants (out of 12/14 rounds) has been one of the most difficult challenges in the cryptanalysis of block ciphers for more than a decade. In this paper, we present the novel technique of block cipher cryptanalysis with bicliques. ... Preimage search for compression functions based on the full AES versions faster than brute force. In contrast to most shortcut attacks on AES variants, we do not need to assume related-keys. Most of our techniques only need a very small part
	   of the codebook and have low memory requirements, and are practically verified to a large extent. As our cryptanalysis is of high computational complexity, it does not threaten the practical use of AES in any way.}},
